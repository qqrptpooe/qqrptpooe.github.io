I have written books, produced online content, consulted with 100s of churches worldwide and traveled to hundreds of churches giving workshops and seminars for church renewal. My team of 5 people in the last 21 years have revitalized 9 churches and we are currently working with a number of struggling churches that will be revitalized. If anyone has seen or learned anything about revitalization I think it is us. I am the professor at my church “Peter’s School for Churches”. We have a very high success rate with our work. But there is one thing that we see again and again and that’s how church consultation often fail, why? It may be one key reason.\nDefinition of Church Consultation Definition: A meeting with someone to gather information, advise about problems or strategize for change.\nSounds easy enough. We’ve all been to a consulting meeting like that before. The school district called and needs your help with a troubled child. Your boss, as you know, has lots of advice for you at work. Your friends drop by to get your opinion on a choice between two colleges or a boyfriend/girlfriend.\nChurch consultation works the same way. And that’s the problem. All too often church consultants, even well-meaning ones, don’t fully grasp the significance of what they are doing. They say the wrong things, ask the wrong questions, or come up with some scheme that fails to meet the real need of the church. They just don’t get it. So church consultation fails. Why? Here’s a short list of common reasons I’ve found in my experience:\nOne Key Reason Why Church Consultations Fail 1) Church consultant doesn’t know what they are talking about I have heard this many times at seminars and conferences. Church consultants who do not understand church work or have limited experience give unhelpful and sometimes bad advice. This is not a condemnation of professionals who move into new areas, it just shows that having a professional title (researchers, psychiatrists, lawyers, doctors, etc.) does not necessarily mean we know what we are talking about.\n2) Church consultant doesn’t care enough to find out what they are talking about This may sound harsh but it is true more often than not. Many people will give their time as a church consultant only if they are paid or benefit from their investment of time. We cannot stop caring because we feel ill-equipped or uneducated. Church consultant who do not understand church work or do not have experience should find someone who can teach them about church matters before giving advice to churches.\n3) Church consultant doesn’t believe what you are saying This is also a very common mistake church consultants make when visiting struggling churches. Their disbelief could come from a general lack of faith in human nature, or specific issues with your pastor, etc. They may be unwilling to believe that it is possible for a pastor who makes $60,000 a year to struggle with money.\n4) The church consultant is not sensitive enough to the current situation All too often church consultants forget that they are supposed to be visiting churches on behalf of Christ! They forget that we are to come alongside struggling churches with love and compassion (as well as truth). Unfortunately, when a church consultant visits a struggling church they often come across as cold and uncaring.\n5) The church consultant doesn’t have enough experience Sometimes church consultants have years of experience. Sometimes they do not! Consultants should not assume that their prior work in other sectors or fields will automatically transfer over. They can take advantage of their experience to help them be better prepared for church consultation work, but they should never make assumptions.\n6) The church consultant assumes that his/her way is the best way This is perhaps the most common mistake I see church consultants make. Too many times they try to give advice based on their own opinions and beliefs without taking enough time to consider yours! This is especially true if you do not agree with everything he/she says – then the consultation becomes a lecture rather than a dialogue.\n7) The church consultant does not believe in your ability or potential to change It’s true that sometimes church consultants will visit a struggling church, see little chance of turning around its fortunes, and offer no hope for it to ever become vibrant or self-sustaining again. However this doesn’t mean we should give up hope! We must learn to see past the current situation and realize there is hope for the future.\n8) The church consultant has an agenda other than helping the church A surprising number of church consultants are primarily focused on themselves, their ministry, and their needs. They may be trying to raise funds for their own projects or ministry, grow the membership in their church, or sell you something. It is a mistake to confuse genuine concern with selfish intent and most consultants are motivated by a genuine desire to help churches.\n9) The church consultant is impatient with the pace of change This is another common mistake I see church consultants make. There are times where patience is required while a church changes! We cannot expect instant results from prayer, slow gradual action from deliberate planning, or fast miracles from God! God will always work in His own timing regardless of our desires for quick results.\n10) The church consultant has failed to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit This is perhaps the most important of all reasons why church consultations fail. When we attempt to make changes without seeking God first, we run the risk of making mistakes that hurt people and churches (and ourselves!). Even when our motives are good it’s vital that we spend time in prayer before beginning any major shift so that we can follow God’s leading instead of our own desire for change!\n11) The church consultant does not respect the authority of Scripture A surprising number of church consultants take their cues from Scripture to guide them. Church consultants are increasingly relying on the Bible for insight, guidance, and direction – instead of relying solely upon their own best judgment! This is a very important shift in perspective because it reminds us that God’s Word is our ultimate authority and source of knowledge/wisdom.\n12) The church consultant has unrealistic expectations of what they can accomplish This is sometimes the case with church consultants who are under the illusion that they can bring about radical change quickly! Or maybe their own experiences have taught them that the more urgent things seem to be, the better chance for success. The truth is we’ll never make any real progress by moving so fast we end up ignoring or missing crucial details/elements along the way!\n13) The church consultant is not genuinely interested in the welfare of the people in the church Sadly, some church consultants lack sincere concern for people’s welfare. They may view themselves as “above” other people, have an air of superiority and judgement, and feel that their advice is infallible, sacred, or above discussion. This type of arrogance does not lead us into a relationship with Jesus Christ but drives us apart from God!\n14) The church consultant views ministry from a position of power rather than service This mistake occurs when church consultants seek to help in places where their help is neither needed nor wanted; it also happens when we try to do the work for the church instead of partnering with those already there. The Bible teaches that humility is a virtue – but sadly it is not common among many Christians today!\n15) The church consultant operates out of fear rather than faith Fear can be a very powerful motivator, but often leads us away from God because it blocks our ability to trust Him! If we allow fear to cripple us, we will never live out our purpose in life which means we’ll fail at ministry too. However, if we learn to deal with our fears, we can learn to walk in faith instead!\n16) The church consultant has an idolatrous heart When our heart is led astray by love and money, we become spiritually blind to our own failings. Instead of pursuing holiness, we pursue power or wealth through sinful means! In order for us to do what God wants us to do, we must learn to value Him above everything else – even beyond our own selfish desires!\n17) The church consultant has failed to honestly acknowledge his/her own sinfulness Some people will become church consultants because they think it’s a quick way to gain spiritual “brownie points”. They may do this out of prideful motives, or perhaps they try to earn eternal life by being “good”. However, the Bible clearly states that salvation comes from God alone, not from human effort! Thus anyone who thinks they are earning heaven through their good deeds has lost sight of what really matters…the Gospel!\nConclusion Now that we know what church consultation is, let’s find out why it fails.
