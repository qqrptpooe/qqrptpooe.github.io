In 1972, 65% of respondents to a nationwide Gallup Poll identified themselves as belonging to a church or synagogue. By 1998, only 40% did and by 2010, only 38%.^{1} This is not simply due to an increase in the numbers of people who claim no religious affiliation. According to Pew Research, in 2007, 56% of those who were now identifying themselves as “unaffiliated” would have done so in 1990.^{2} The majority of those leaving religion are not doing so because they are moving away from commitment to Christ. They are finding reasons to leave the church instead.\nCraig Van Gelder describes this changing relationship between the people in our communities and the churches with which they used to identify: “The people in our communities are moving to the edges of their churches. They are still looking, still longing for the type of relationship churches promise. And still being disappointed. Only now they don’t stick around as long. Instead they are moving elsewhere.”^{3}\nThis changing relationship is due in part to the changing nature of the culture itself. The civil religion which once supported and helped define Christianity in America is gone. The one-dimensional response of the church to the social revolutions of the 1960s and 70s has left many in our communities disillusioned. The advances in science are proving that what the Bible says about human origins and the age of the earth, is simplhy not true. The inability of many of our churches to provide genuine community and relationships beyond Sunday services have left people searching outside of the church for what it promises.\nWe cannot address these issues if we do not first understand what it is that people are really looking for. So this study will attempt to describe a basic spiritual profile of most North American people. Then, we will attempt to identify the values and principles which have contributed to the church’s current struggles and to outline how a biblical response to these issues is both possible and necessary.\nA Basic Spiritual Profile A good way to start describing this spiritual profile is by comparing it to another one that is much better known. Since the early 1900s, the Enneagram has bene used to describe nine different types of personality (see chart below). Using this system allows us to see some of the basic values and beliefs of today’s North Americans. It also helps us to understand why some aspects of the Western church are less effective than others.\nIt should be clear that the diagram above shows only the general distinctions between different personality types. Our objective here is simply to use it to help us consider the specific spiritual and ecclesiological challenges that face us in today’s North American context.\nType One – The Perfectionist This personality type is characterized by a desire to be perfect and able to achieve this through the control of others and the avoidance of criticism of self. The challenge they face is their own rigidity of thinking, their attachment to a strong moral center which leads them to judge others and feel justified in rejecting them. Those in this group tend to view the world around them through the eyes of judgment and at the same time, get caught up in trying to control things around them.\nThe church faces two major challenges that result from these struggles. First, it needs to develop an appropriate approach to leadership development which can address the strong desire many Christians have to appear perfect. A failure to do this will result in an over-reliance on perfectionist leaders who are more driven by personal ambition than true servanthood. Secondly, the church needs to find ways to move beyond an accusatory moralism which fails to adequately care for the flawed humanity of people in general, and its own leaders in particular. Failing to address this issue may lead many who fall into this category to abandon the faith altogether and adopt a far more relativistic view of truth and morality.^{5}\nType Two – The Helper This personality type is characterized by a strong desire to connect with others and be loved. People who fall into this category are often very adept at helping others but can become overrly dependent on the approval and admiration of others. Their tendency to see themselves as martyrs can cause them to become rigid in their thinking about what is right and wrong. Many people in this group, tend to want to avoid conflict and prefer to be liked by everyone rather than being honest with them.\nThe church needs to respond by encouraging the development of truly supportive community; one which can effectively address the aloneness and self-denial that this group sometimes suffers from. The other issue the church needs to address is helping people who fall into this category to overcome their fear of being honest with others. If left unaddressed, this can easily lead to a form of church in which only shallow and superficial relationships are allowed. This in turn will leave those who need deep and authentic relationships to find them somewhere else.^{6}\nType Three – The Achiever This personality type is characterized by a strong desire to be successful. The church will encounter two significant challenges with this group. First, they are sometimes highly committed to serving in the church, but prefer to be told what to do by church leaders and avoid being challenged by the leadership. This can lead to an effective organization, but a less effective church body. Secondly, those who are extremely ambitious and driven may lose sight of the core values that the church is built upon. They may compromise truth, become excessively competitive, or have difficulty working as a team.\nThe church needs to help those in this category to discover what it means to minister in ways that put the church and its mission ahead of their own personal reputation, achievement, or successes. The other challenge involves helping people to realize that while they may have many gifts and abilities, it does not always mean that they are called to ministry.^{7}\nType Four – The Romantic Those in this personality category seek a deep connection with themselves, God and others. The Romantics sometimes share a lot in common with the Helpers – at least until we explore what really happens to these two groups when they come face to face with rejection and pain. Most people who fit this personality description are much more interested in avoiding pain than they are in addressing it. They are normally not interested in conflict resolution; they are far too concerned about their own hurt or anger to be willing to take the risks that effective conflict resolution requires.\nThe church faces two significant challenges as well; the first is to help people not to run away from pain or anger. This means developing an understanding of healthy ways of addressing pain and anger, which will allow people to begin to take responsibility for their own lives without becoming bitter and angry. The second challenge is to develop an understanding of healthy ways of dealing with conflict while at the same time avoiding people who have problems with others in the church (or in any setting for that matter). The challenge here is to teach people to recognize their own feelings, acknowledge what they are feeling and to find ways to address those feelings in a healthy way. It also means teaching them how to seek professional help when needed to process what is going on inside of them.^{8}\nType Five – The Observer/Analyst Those in this personality group are introspective and can be very innovative. The challenge they face is their tendency to put off decisions and procrastinate. Their reluctance to commit can lead to an immature faith and keep them from pursuing a truly meaningful relationship with God. Many of these people don’t feel they are worthy of the grace and love of God and tend to struggle in trying to make a truly effective transition from learning to know God, to a fuller commitment to serving Him.\nThe church faces two major challenges. First, it needs to make sure that those who serve in the church actually have a solid foundation in knowing God. Simply having a professional background in theology, serving as a church leader, or leading a small group doesn’t guarantee that one’s life is lived out as a follower of Christ. Failing to address this issue may leave many people on the margins of the church who aren’t really committed to faith in Christ, but have inherited the cultural expectation of belonging to a church. Secondly, the church needs to develop a servant-leadership model, which allows this group of people to embrace and develop their innovativeness, while minimizing their ability to take excessive risks. This will encourage this group to embrace their calling, and lead them to continue to pursue God with a greater passion.^{9}\nType Six – The Loyal Skeptic People who fall into this group are good at believing and following those they trust. They can be great leaders, followers, or innovators. Their greatest challenge is allowing their fears of loss and betrayal to lead them to over-confidence in human reasoning and knowledge. This can lead them down a path where they lose their faith.\nWhen people enter the church who fall into this category they need to realize that the church is not like “them.” In order for this group to effectively serve Christ, they will need to be encouraged to\n","wordCount":"1619","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-07T15:46:31Z","dateModified":"2024-03-07T15:46:31Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://qqrptpooe.github.io/posts/22966453-why-people-are-losing-their-religion-and-how-the-church-can-respond/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"QQrptpooe","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://qqrptpooe.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://qqrptpooe.github.io/ accesskey=h title="QQrptpooe (Alt + H)">QQrptpooe</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why People Are Losing Their Religion (and How the Church Can Respond)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-07 15:46:31 +0000 UTC'>March 7, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="A Basic Spiritual Profile">A Basic Spiritual Profile</a><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Type One – The Perfectionist">Type One – The Perfectionist</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Type Two – The Helper">Type Two – The Helper</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Type Three – The Achiever">Type Three – The Achiever</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Type Four – The Romantic">Type Four – The Romantic</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Type Five – The Observer/Analyst">Type Five – The Observer/Analyst</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Type Six – The Loyal Skeptic">Type Six – The Loyal Skeptic</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In the last four decades, the United States has seen a dramatic decline in the number of Americans who claim to be affiliated with a Christian church.
