However, there is a common misconception about Christian fundamentalism that can be harmful to people’s faith journeys. While there are certainly elements of fundamentalist belief systems that can be harmful, such as gender roles, shaming others for their beliefs or lack thereof, and othering those who don’t align with a specific belief system, fundamentalism can also be used to empower people in their own faith journeys....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-13 00:32:28 +0000 UTC'>March 13, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Good and the Bad of Christian Fundamentalism" href=https://qqrptpooe.github.io/posts/85708222-the-good-and-the-bad-of-christian-fundamentalism/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Guilt and the Great Deception in the Christian Life</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>What is guilt? How does it impact our lives? And how can we overcome it in our Christian life? These questions will be explored further in this article.

As long as that is true, why should anyone try to sue us?” The answer to this question may be the most important reason why churches need liability insurance.
The issue is whether or not to take responsibility for the actions of the individual members of the congregation who are acting on behalf of the church, knowing that the members are probably also covered by some type of personal insurance such as homeowners or car insurance....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-11 15:57:48 +0000 UTC'>March 11, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Why the Church Should Take Responsibility for Its Liberties and Freedoms" href=https://qqrptpooe.github.io/posts/91214091-why-the-church-should-take-responsibility-for-its-liberties-and-freedoms/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>4 Keys to Building Confidence in God When Life Falls Apart</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Today I want to continue what we started on Friday.

I still believe that kind people make a better world, but I’ve also learned that the emphasis on kindness above all other traits can lead to a handful of problems that are endemic in the church.
Types of Kindness in Christianity There are two main ideas of kindness in Christianity: The virtue of love (which I will refer to as “Goodness” from here-in) and the sacrificial love of God/Jesus (which I will refer to as “Sacrifice” from here-in)....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-09 14:55:27 +0000 UTC'>March 9, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Why Christians Can Be Bad at Being Kind" href=https://qqrptpooe.github.io/posts/28695883-why-christians-can-be-bad-at-being-kind/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Why Are There So Many Ideas about Heaven That Are Not Biblical?</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Think of heaven as you’d like it to be, then think again.
